# Domain Testing

Domain Testing is our fields most widely taught technique. You might know it by another name, equivalence class analysis or boundary testing. Together these are described as Domain Testing where a domain is a set of set of values.

- Equivalence class is about finding similarity. Two values are in the same class if they are so similar the program would treat them the same way. Testing with one or two best representatives from each class allows us to substantially reduce the number of required tests.

- Boundary testing is about selecting and using a boundary value in an attempt to show the program in-appropriately accepts a value instead of rejecting it.

It should be possible to automate domain tests.
