Software Test Design

Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test. We design different types of tests to reveal different types of information.
Each test technique can have one or more characteristic. Focusing on the right characteristic depends on the technique:

- Functional Testing
- Domain Testing
