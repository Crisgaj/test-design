# Software Test Design

This repo (and eventually the website) is an attempt to research and consolidate the valuable test design content out there in the world and bring it into one place for the social good of the software community. We believe articles, videos, books and examples that others can use to develop competence in these skills will help the community at large.

Testing is a complex mental activity and developing competence in it requires conscious effort. Here's to helping with that effort.

Over 100 test techniques are believed to be in existence. Our initial goal will be to focus on the most popular.

## Background:

Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test. We design different types of tests to focus our work on a certain kind of information, such as tests that evaluate a program's consistency with specifications or how easy it is to use. We call these similar kinds of tests test techniques.

## Test Techniques:

Certain techniques will be better optimized for exposing some kinds of bugs and worse for others. Therefore it's best to ask which combination of techniques is best for a given project. The best combination of test techniques will be different for each project.

- A test technique is a way of designing, running and interpreting the results of tests.
- You can use any test technique in an exploratory or scripted way.

### Most common techniques:

- Automated Testing
- Combination Testing
- Domain Testing
- Flow Testing
- Functional Testing
- Risk-Based Testing
- Scenario Testing
- Stress / Performance Testing

### Characteristics:

Each test technique helps us focus on a few characteristics. Some will have one or more primary characteristics and several secondary characteristics such as:

- Scope
- Coverage
- Testers
- Potential Problems (risks)
- Activities
- Evaluation / oracles
- Desired result
